One more dance at this after party
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)
We get wild like a safari
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)
All we need, good things, good things, good things
We party like Post Malone
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
See the ocean there in your eyes
We are, we are in a zone
